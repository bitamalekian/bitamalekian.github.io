  <!-- Integrated Story -->
  <section class="section">
    <p>
      My name is Bita Malekianboroujeni, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University. I also work as a teaching assistant for digital design, where I help students test circuits on FPGA boards, fix timing issues, and see how ideas on paper can become real. Teaching has shown me how important it is to explain things clearly and to organize problems in a way that makes sense to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to grow in the same way for my own career. I do not only want to solve technical problems, but also design systems that are clear, simple, and easy for people to use. That is why I chose to take Human-Computer Interaction. The class connects my technical background with skills that make technology more human-centered. By learning how to design and study user experiences, from usability rules to persuasive technologies, I can prepare myself for the job market and also become the kind of engineer who builds tools that people enjoy and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courses I have already taken give me a good start. In Data Visualization, I learned how to turn data into clear visual stories that help people see meaning without feeling lost. In Artificial Intelligence, I learned how modern systems make decisions, which can be powerful but hard to understand. Human-Computer Interaction adds the missing piece: how to design these systems so they are usable, ethical, and easy for people to work with. These courses together give me both the technical base and the human focus I need to design useful and responsible technology. This course is more than just part of my degree. It is helping me grow into an engineer who can design technology that is useful, easy to understand, and meaningful for the people who use it.

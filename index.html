  <!-- Integrated Story -->
  <section class="section">
    <p>
      My name is Bita Malekianboroujeni, and I am an M.S. student in Computer Engineering (Non-Thesis) at Texas A&amp;M University. I also work as a teaching assistant for digital design. In the lab, I help students run their FPGA projects, fix timing issues, and understand how what they learn in class can be applied to real hardware. This experience has taught me how important it is to explain things in a clear way and to solve problems step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to take Human-Computer Interaction because I want to improve my problem-solving and communication skills while also learning about an area that is very important in todayâ€™s job market. The course focuses on human-centered design and user experience, which are skills that can make technology easier and more enjoyable to use. I believe this will help me become a stronger candidate for future jobs and also a better engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the courses I have already taken connect well with HCI. In Data Visualization, I learned how to present information in a way that makes sense and is easy to understand. In Artificial Intelligence, I studied how modern systems work and make decisions. These classes gave me a good background, but HCI adds the part that is missing: how to design systems that are clear, ethical, and easy for people to work with. This course is not just another requirement for me. It is helping me grow into someone who can design technology that is useful and meaningful for the people who use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the university, I am very into going to the gym. Fitness is a big part of my life, and in addition to pursuing a career in technology, I also want to become a personal trainer. My goal is to have both: a professional role in tech and a future where I can coach others in fitness, possibly through my own platform that connects these two interests.
